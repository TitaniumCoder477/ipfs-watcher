# ipfs-watcher.sh 
ipfs-watcher is a script I wrote to manage my IPFS website. Here is what it does:
1. Attempts to start the daemon (ipfs daemon)
2. Attempt to process one or more hashes (ipfs name publish)

The best way to run it is to configure a crontab. See the script header for more information!

Thanks!
